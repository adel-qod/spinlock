File organization:
	* One class per cpp file
	* Every class MUST have a corresponding header file


Header files:
	* Only one class is included per header
	* Header file names should be the same as the class name they contain
	* Always have an include guard
	* The include guard has the form: PATH_TO_FILE_CLASS_NAME_H
	* Include any other headers in the order:
		System specific (eg unistd.h socket.h)
		C standard library headers
		C++ standard library headers
		External libraries headers
		Project headers
	* Macros are NOT ALLOWED in header files
	* Classes have their attributes ordered this way:
		constructor/s (if public)
		public methods(not setter/getter methods)
		Operators
		public methods(setter/getter methods)
		public constants
		public variables
		destructor
		- then as in the previous order
		protected .
		- then as in the previous order
		private .

	
C++ files:
	* Include headers following the same style previously specified
	* Any macros must follow the includes and precede the code
	* Every function must leave exactly one blank line before it
	* Functions/methods appear in the same order as they appeared in the 
		corresponding header file	
Style issues:
	** Names:
	* Class names are CamelCase
	* All other names use under-scores and all lower-case
		Example:
		bool is_free();
	* Public variables must have descriptive names and no abbreviations
	* Private variables can be short and use abbreviations as long
		as they are private inside a function and the meaning is 
		clear even to a 5 years old child.
	* Constants and macros are ALL_CAPS
	* Hungarian notation is strictly prohibited

	** Identation:
	* Use tabs, never spaces
	* Try not to exceed 4 levels

	** Curely braces:
	* In case of functions and classes, they are NEVER placed at the 
		same line as the decalarition but always after it
		Example:
		void foo() 
		{
		}

		class Bar
		{
		};
	* For the conditionals(if, switch, loops), they follow the conditional
		clause with exactly one space in between:
		Example:
		if() {
		}
	
	** Do not add 'using namespace' statements, use full names

	** Never let your code width exceed the 80 characters per line

	** Comments:
		* Use only the // comments with exactly one space between the
			the text and the // 
		* Comments precede the thing being descriped OR they are on the
			same line as the thing being descriped if they can be
			contained in one line
**Language features:
	** Memory:
		* Alloacte on the stack as long as you know it's safe to do so
		* Allocate on the heap only when:
			The object is huge
			OR
			The object needs to live on after its scope
		* Avoid using raw-pointers at all costs, use smart-pointers
		* Use std::unique_ptr as your default and std::shared_ptr
			only when you know the object has to be shared
		* If there is a truly exceptional case that requires raw 
			pointers, then use them with care and never return
			them from a public/protected method
		* Use RAII; really, just use it.
	** Parameters:
		* Pass parameters by const reference as your default
		* When you have a smart-pointer to an object, pass it as
			a smart-pointer not as a reference to the object or
			a pointer to it.
		* Passing the smart-pointers themselves by reference isn't a
			bad idea and you're encouraged to do so.
		* When writing a method/function and you don't know what the 
			caller will pass (that is, you don't know what kind 
			of allocation they made); then your parameters should
			be references (and const whenever possible)
	** Integers:
		* Use int and unsigned int only; nothing else
		* When you need a larger range or specific bit-length
			include <cstdint>
	** Typedef:
		* Do not use them; and no, they don't make pointers or objects
			more readable
	** auto type:
		* Don't ever use them as parameters, and avoid using them 
			unless any code reader can tell right away what the
			object truly is
	** assert
		* Never use it to check for error-handling; it's a debugging 
			tool.
		* A good usage is to put your pre-conditions in assertions.
	** Atomics:
		* Do not use the = operator or other operators that are 
			overloaded by default, use the explicit functions.
			It makes spotting atomics in code easier.
	** Boost:
		* Avoid using Boost when there's something in the Standard 
			Library you can use instead.
